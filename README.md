#MyPortfolio

This is my personal portfolio repository.
This is me trying to use git and gitHub for the first time.

I am a self learning web-developer and hoping to learn and earn with the help of the skills that I acquire along the way.

If you are visiting for the first time.
Thanks for visiting here.

I don't really know what people write in the ReadMe section, but this is me being natural, making mistakes and learning on my way.
